An anatomical image
###################

Now we will work with a 3D brain image.

Like the camera image in :doc:`camera`, the pixel data for the 3D
image is in a text file called ``anatomical.txt``.  Download
:download:`anatomical.txt <../_downloads/anatomical.txt>` to your working
directory.

I happen to know this image has is length 32 on the third dimension,
but I don't know what the size of the first two dimensions are.

So, I know the image is of shape (``I``, ``J``, 32), but I don't know
what ``I`` and ``J`` are.

Here are the first four lines of ``anatomical.txt``.

::

    0.0000
    0.0000
    53.0000
    43.0000

The data is in the same floating point text format as the camera
picture pixel data.

Real all the lines of the file into a list of float values, as before.

::

    # Read the lines into a list of floats

How many pixel values does this file contain?

When I have my image array correctly shaped, then, if I take a slice
over the third dimension:

::

    slice_on_third = image_array[:, :, 0]

``slice_on_third`` will be shape ``(I, J)`` (the size of the first two
dimensions).

So, how many pixel values does a slice in the third dimension contain
|--| given that we know the third dimension is length 32? Put another
way, what is the value for ``I * J``?

.. code:: python

    # Find the size of a slice over the third dimension
    # P = ?

Call ``P`` the number of values per slice on the third dimension (so
``P == I * J`` where we don't yet know ``I`` or ``J``).

Is this slice over the third dimension square (does ``I == J``)?

We need to find the values for ``I`` and ``J``.

Find candidates for ``I`` by using the modulus operator (``%``) to
find a few numbers between 120 and 200 that divide exactly into the
slice size ``P``. Hint: the first value will be 120.

::

    # Make a list of canidates for I

These numbers are candidates for ``I`` - the first number in the pair
``(I, J)``. We now need to find the corresponding ``J`` for each
candidate for ``I``.

Use the integer division operator (``//``) to get a list of pairs of
numbers ``I`` and ``J`` such that ``I * J == P``. Hint: the first pair
of ``I, J`` is (120, 221).

::

    # Make list of pairs of I, J such that I * J == P

The full image shape will be three values, with one of these ``(I,
J)`` pairs followed by 32. For example, the correct shape might be
(120, 221 , 32) (it isn't!). Try reshaping the pixel data with a few
of the ``(I, J, 32)`` candidates to see which one is likely to be
right. You might want to plot a slice over the third dimension to see
how it looks.

::

    # Make the pixel values list into an array
    # Try reshaping the array with candidate triples of (I, J, 32)
    # Which I, J, 32 triple is the right one?
